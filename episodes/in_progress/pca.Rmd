## Dimension reduction

We call the concept of taking a dataset with many variables ("dimensions"), and
reducing it to fewer variables while keeping important information: "Dimension reduction".

Imagine a table with 100 columns (variables or features). A lot of them might
be correlated, noisy or redundant. Instead of working with all 100 features, we
might be able to identify or summarise the important structure or information
of the data, using only 5 or 6 features (or variables)

We could pick out the most important variables and use only those to describe the
data. This is more or less what we do when we make a multiple linear regression:
We try to explain the variability in the data, using a selection of a few variables.
But we might need a lot of variables to explain enough of the variability. Any two
variables might not be able to explain more than 10% of the variability.

It would be nice if by combining them in a clever way, we could construct new
variables that explain more of the data.

## Principal Component Analysis

One of the ways we can do that is by Principal Component Analysis, or PCA

It constructs, algorithmically
(or automatically) a set of new variables. It is not able to explain more
of the variance than the original 100 variables. But it might be able to 
construct one new variable that explains 60% of the variability, and another,
second one, that explain 25%. Those two new features alone would then
explain a total of 85% of the variability of the data. 

It does this by taking the existing coordinate system, where each axis corresponds
to one variable, and making a new coordinate system, whre the variability of the
data is better explained.

Imagine a friendly blue whale, oriented like this in the coordinate system:

![](../fig/horst_pca_1.jpg)
How would you rotate the whale for it to be able to catch as much krill as 
possible, if the krill is scattered like this?

![](../fig/horst_pca_2.jpg)

Yep, you would rotate the whale 45 degrees. This is what we do when we run a 
principal component analysis. We rotate the coordinate system in order to
catch as much variability as possible.

# Doing it

Let us look at some data, in this case wine. 

Begin by downloading the wine dataset from the "data sets" menu under "More" on this website.
Or do it with code like this:

```{r data_download, eval = FALSE}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KUBDatalab/R-toolbox/main/episodes/data/wine.data",
               destfile = "data/wine.data")
```

And then read it in:

```{r reading_wine_dont_run, eval = FALSE}
wine <- read_csv("data/wine.data", col_names = FALSE)
```


```{r reading_wine_dont_show, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
wine <- read_csv("../data/wine.data", col_names = FALSE)
```

The data looks like this:

```{r}
head(wine)
```
In the [metadata description](https://kubdatalab.github.io/R-toolbox/data.html#wine)
we can see what kind of measurement each variable contains.

Three different "cultivars", basically types of grapes, have been examined. We 
can note that the units of the variables differ widely, and that the values are 
also quite different, as shown by the mean of the values for each cultivar:

```{r}
wine |> group_by(X1) |> 
  summarise(across(X2:X14, mean))
```

We have 13 dimensions, and our thesis is, that by
measuring these values, we should be able to diffentiate between the three
cultivars. 

Making density plots of all the dimensions, we can observe that there are 
differences. If the variable X13 is low, it is probably cultivar 3. But we 
are not able to use any of the variables to conclusively differentiate between
them. But we still believe that the aggregate variability in all the variables
together will be able to discriminate between them.

```{r}
wine |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = X2:X14) |> 
  mutate(X1 = factor(X1)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=value, color = X1, group = X1)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free")
```

So we will construct a new coordinate system, based on the original 
coordinates/features/variables, that better catch the variablity.

This is machinelearning, and we would like to make sure that the machine does
not have acccess to the cheatsheet. In order to avoid this, we extract the 
column containing the correct answer, X1, where we have information about the
cultivars.

```{r}
cultivars <- wine |> pull(X1)
```

Next we prepare the data, by removing X1:

```{r}
wine_to_pca <- wine |> select(-X1)
```


We are now ready to run the PCA, using the `prcomp()` function:

```{r run-pca, echo  =F}
pca_wine <- prcomp(wine_to_pca, scale. = TRUE)
```

The new coordinates of the data is stored in the `pca_wine` object, more 
precisely in `pca_wine$x`. We can plot that, and color the points using
the correct results we extracted earlier:


```{r pca-plot}
pca_wine$x |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2, colour = factor(cultivars))) + 
  geom_point()

```

This give a not complete, but still pretty good, separation of the three
cultivars.

## What did the function return?

We made a plot of the `x` component of the result. What else is in there?

```{r}
pca_wine |> names()
```

Let us look at each of them. First "x"

```{r}
pca_wine$x |> head()
```
This is the coordinates in the new coordinate system. The plot was made using
only the first two of the new features/variables/dimensions, and we do that firstly
because we have trouble plotting more than two dimensions, but also because the
function organises the new features, or Principal Components, in a specific
order. `PC1` is the component that explains the most variability in the
original data. `PC2` is the component explaining the second most. Therefore 
these two dimensions are the most important, as they explain more than the
others.

### Scale og center

```{r}
pca_wine$center
```

```{r}
pca_wine$scale
```

These two components describes how our data was scaled and centered. All the 
observations in the X2 variable have had 13.0006180 subtracted, and been divided
by 0.8118265. The result is that X2 after this procedure have a mean of 0, and 
a standard deviation of 1, which makes the math easier to both do and interpret.

We will return to that in details later.

### sdev

This describes how large the standard deviation of the principal components is.


```{r}
pca_wine$sdev
```

This is a measure of how much of the overall variability of the data has been
captured by each component. Note that the first component is the largest.

## Rotation

The rotation of the model describes how the principal components have been 
constructed, how the original dimensions/variables/features, have been 
"rotated" in order to construct the principal components:

```{r}
pca_wine$rotation
```
For a given observation in the data, knowing the values of its X2 to X14 
variables (after centering and scaling), we can calculate the value of the
first principal component using_
PC1 = -0.144329395*X2 + 0.245187580*X3 + 0.002051061*X4 + 0.239320405*X5 - 0.141992042*X6 - 0.394660845*X7 - 0.422934297*X8 + 
0.298533103*X9 -0.313429488*X10 + 0.088616705*X11 - 0.296714564*X12 
 - 0.376167411*X13 - 0.286752227*X14 

## I thought we wanted to reduce the dimensions?

And yet we still have 13 variables/dimensions/components/features?

Yes. `prcomp` returns 13 principal components, which is not a reduction in
dimensions. But we are able to separate the cultivars using only two, 
perhaps three principal components. And 3 is smaller than 13.


## Scaling and centering

Note that we set the argument `scale. = TRUE` in `prcomp()`. This will scale
the data before doing the actual PCA. Why do we do that?

Remember the means we calculated earlier. One of the varibles had a mean of
746, and the variable with the smallest mean was X9 with a mean of 0.3619.

A relative change of 5% in X14 will be 37, and in X9 0.0181. If the variables 
are not scaled, the variables with the larger values, will completely dominate 
the result.

Must we always scale the variables? Yes, and no. As a general rule of thumb,
if the variables have different orders of magnitude, or are measured in
different units, we should (probably) scale the date. But for some applications,
especially in economics and in the technical or geophysical sciences, the 
high variance is actually important, and we might prefer not to scale the data.

It depends.

Looking at the help for `prcomp` we find that we can also change the default
value of `center´ to FALSE. By default the data is always centeret, and for all
practical purposes we have to do that. If we set `center = FALSE`, the first
principal component will primarily point in the direction of the mean of the
individual original variables, witch is not very informative. 


## Can we use this to classify the data?

Jep. Men det gør vi ved at køre en klassifikationsalgo på 
resultaterne af pca'en.

## What does scaling and centering look like?

We can scale or not. And we can center. Or not. The four combinations in the
example with data on wine looks like this:

```{r echo = FALSE}
pca_ct_st <- prcomp(wine_to_pca, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)$x |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  mutate(cultivar = cultivars)
pca_ct_sf <- prcomp(wine_to_pca, center = TRUE, scale. = FALSE)$x |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  mutate(cultivar = cultivars)
pca_cf_st <- prcomp(wine_to_pca, center = FALSE, scale. = TRUE)$x |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  mutate(cultivar = cultivars)
pca_cf_sf <- prcomp(wine_to_pca, center = FALSE, scale. = FALSE)$x |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  mutate(cultivar = cultivars)

ct_st <- pca_ct_st |> 
  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2, colour = factor(cultivar))) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Both centering and scaling") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

ct_sf <- pca_ct_sf |> 
  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2, colour = factor(cultivar))) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Centering, no scaling") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

cf_st <- pca_cf_st |> 
  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2, colour = factor(cultivar))) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Scaling, no centering") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

cf_sf <- pca_cf_sf |> 
  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2, colour = factor(cultivar))) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Neither scaling, nor centering") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

ct_st + ct_sf + cf_st + cf_sf

```

In this case, it is clear that we should both scale and center our data
to get the best separation between the three cultivars
::::

## How can we visualise this?

We already have - All data according to the first two principal components

But if we want PC3 vs PC4, that is straight forward:

```{r}
pca_wine$x |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  ggplot(aes(PC3, PC4, colour = factor(cultivars))) + 
  geom_point()
```

Most of the variation has been captured by the first two principal components,
so it is not surprising that there is no apparent patterns in the third and
fourth.

We had sdev describing the standard deviation of the individual components,
which describe the amount of the variance in the data explained. A more
intuitive value is the variance, which we find by squareing the standard deviation.

This is the same as the eigenvalues in the covariance matrix of the data:

```{r}
eigen_values <- pca_wine$sdev^2
```

If we divide each eigen_value with the sum of them all, we get the percentage
of the total variance in the data that each principal component explains, and
we can plot that:

```{r}
plot(eigen_values/sum(eigen_values), type = "b",
     xlab = "Principal Component",
     ylab = "Percentage of Variance Explained")
abline(v = 2, col = "red")
```

This gives us an indication of how many principal components we need to explain
the variance of the data. Using all of them we can of course explain everything,
but we would like to only include enough - the goal was afterall to reduce the
dimensions. 

What we are looking for is the "elbow" of this socalled "scree" plot. The point
where the curve changes, and where adding an extra principal component does not
provide a significant improvement to the model.

There are several ways of locating the elbow.

## Assumptions and prerequisites

There are some prerequisites that have to be fulfilled in order to 
be able to run a PCA.
1. All variables have to be numerical, and continous
2. Linearity - PCA assumes linear relations between the varibles. It is a linear
method, as indicated by the fact that the principal components are found as linear combinations of the variables.
3. No (strong) multicoliniarity. Any variables that are very strongly correlated, or
(almost) equal, they should be excluded.
4. Adequate variance in the data. If data is almost constant, or if there
are too few observations relative to the number of variables, we cannot expect
PCA to work well.

Recommendations

* The number of observations have to be larger than the number of variables. 
Preferably much larger. 
* If possible work on normally distributed data. This is not a requirement, but
recommended. 
* Consider identifying and removing outliers, as PCA is sensitive to outliers.

Hvis du bruger eigen(cov(data)) eller eigen(cor(data)), så får du:

vectors = loadings

prcomp() beregner PCA via SVD, men resultatet er identisk mht. sdev² = eigenvalues.
