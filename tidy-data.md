## Introduction
Tidy data is not the opposite of messy data. Data can be 
nice and well structured, tidy, without being tidy in the 
way we understand it in this context.

“Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.”
— Hadley Wickham

Tidy data in the world of R, especially the dialect of R we 
call tidyverse, are characterized by:

* Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.
* Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.
* Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.
