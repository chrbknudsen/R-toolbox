Welcome to the KUB Datalab R-toolbox course site.

This site is a collection of individual episodes. It is not intended
as a single course. The concept is for this site to act as the  foundation for made-to-measure courses.
Based on the individual and specific needs in a given situation, we will make a 
selection of relevant episodes, and string them together to form a tailored 
course,.


## Prerequisites 

We expect you to have R and RStudio installed, or have an account on [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/).

We also expect you to have a basic knowledge of R, and that you have a rudimentary
grasp of the concepts of the Tidyverse. We recommend one of our [introductory
courses](https://kubdatalab.github.io/R-intro/).
