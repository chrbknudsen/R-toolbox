Welcome to the KUB Datalab R-toolbox course site.

This site is a collection of individual episodes. It is not intended
as a single course. The concept is for this site to act as the  foundation for made-to-measure courses.
Based on the individual and specific needs in a given situation, we will make a 
selection of relevant episodes, and string them together to form a tailored 
course,.

The episodes are under construction, and will continue to be, as we will
add new content until we have covered any subject that might arise working with
data. That is: We will never be done.
