<!-- Referencer er lidt bøvlet... Vi laver dem ved at indsætte interne links.
TJEK at nummereringen er som den skal være hvis du ændrer noget.

Vi vil gerne have de der "1 er dette præparat, 2 det andet" i
en celle, snarere end i nye linier - stribningen er forvirrende.

Og vi kunne også godt tænke os dimensionerne angivet i beskrivelsen.

### BETACAR

Data from a study of bio availability of four different preparations of 
betacarotene:

1. Solaten (30 mg capsules)
2. Roche (60 mg capsules)
3. Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik (BASF) (30 mg capsules)
4. BASF (60 mg capsules)

23 volunteers had their beta-carotene levels measured in two consecutive-day
fasting blood samples. They were then randomized to one of the four preparations,
and took 1 pill every other day for 12 weeks. Blood samples were drawn after 
6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks.

### BLOOD 

A case-control study of riskfactors (hormone levels in blood samples) for 
breast cancer. Individuals are matched on age and current postmenopausal homone
use (PMH). 

Each row contains unique ID, representing both cases (have breast cancer) and
control (does not have breast cancer). The column matchid matches the controls
with their respective cases. Cases have identical ID and matchid.

Note the different ways of coding missing values.

Useful for logistic regression to assess the association between testosterone
and breast cancer, controlling for age and current PMH use. Either with testosterone
as a continuous variable or as a categorical variabel in quartiles, with the first
quartile as the reference group.

### BOTOX

69 patients with piriformis syndrome participated in a randomized double-blind 
clinical trial. 

Piriformis syndrom is a condition involving malfunction of the
piriformis muscle - a deep buttock muscle, which often causes buttock and lumbar 
pain with sciatica. 

Patients were injected with one of three substances directly in the piriformis muscle:

1. a combination of triamcinolone and lidocaine (TL)
2. a placebo
3. Botox

The randomization was set up with approximately ½ assigned to group 1, 1/6 to 
group 2 and 1/3 to group 3. 

Patients were asked to return 2 weeks (0.5), and monthly post injection. At each
visit patients rated their percentage of improvement of pain comparied to baseline,
on a visual analog scale, with a range of -100 to 100%, negative numbers indicating
worsening. One patient had the condition in both legs leading to 70 observations
in the dataset.

### BREAST

A dataset describing 1200 women in the NHS. In 1990 it was confirmed that they
were postmenopausal and free of any cancer. The selection was done so that
200 of the women were using postmenopausal hormones (PMH) in 1990, and 1000 had 
never used PMH. 
The objective was to identify a possible relation between incidence of breast 
cancer between 1990 to 2000 with PMH use in 1990.

The objective was to relate breast cancer incidence from 1990 to 2000 
with PMH use in 1990. Data on PMH use are found in three variables, `pmh` registers
PMH use in 1990, where `dur3` and `dur4` registers length of use of two different 
PMH. In the variable `foluptm` the time between the first questionnaire (in 1990),
and a follow up date is recorded in months. If a control that follow up date was
the date of the last questionnaire in 2000, if a case, the date of diagnosis of breast 
cancer.
Other cancer risk factors are recorded.

###  CORNEAL

Data from a randomized trial of two different active drugs of the fluoroquinolone-group,
M and G along with a placebo, P.
93 subjects were placed in one of three groups:

| Group | Eye 1 | Eye 2|
|-------|-------|------|
|   A   |  G    |  P   |
|   B   |  M    |  P   |
|   C   |  G    |  M   |

Each subject was asked to administer the two assigned preparations four times 
per day for 10 days. The response was measured at baseline (without treatment),
on visit 1, and again at visit 2 after 7 days, and at visit 3, on day 14. Note
that at day 14, the subjects had stopped administering the preparations. The
response was meased as corneal sensitivity in five regions of the eyes, central,
superior, inferior, temporal and nasal. Sensititivy was measured in mm, with
a range for 40-60 mm. High values indicate greater, normal, sensitivity, low values
lower, abnormal, sensitivity.

### DIABETES

A study on whether maintaining diabetes control in type I diabetes affects growth
and development in childhood. 94 boys aged 9-15 where examined approx. every 
3 months, leading to 910 visits. At each visit the degree of diabetes control 
where assessed by measuring HgbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin). The exact dates 
of the visits are registered in the mon, day and yr_a1c variables, the age, 
height and weight where registered as well ad the HgbA1c measurement.

The HgbA1c measurement is the percentage of hemoglobin that is glycosylated.
The normal range is between 4.0 and 5.6%, with values larger than 6.5% being
indicative of diabetes. The normal range does not appear to change by pubertal stage.

### EFF

Data from a litterature search on the efficacy (that is - is it working?) of
a number of aminoglycosides for the treatment of infectious diseases. 

Note that this dataset is basically the same as the dataset NEPHRO, where the
nephrotoxicity of the preparations described in the same papers is reported.

We get the sample size of patients in different studies, and the number of 
patients that were cured for their infection. Which antibiotic is best?

### ESTROGEN

The influence on different doses of estrogen on systolic and diastolic blood pressure
is investigated. 31 subjects are placed into 1 of three study types, and recives
treatment two times for four weeks, with a two week washout period between.

Are there any significant differences between the different treatments - or carry over
effects on blood pressure in the different groups.

### FEV

Data on 654 children seen in the [Childhood Respiratory Disease Study](#tage_6)^6^ in East Boston 
Massachusetts in 1980. Forced Expiratory Volumne (FEF), an index of pulmonary
function was measured, along with, age, height, sex and smoking status. 

FEV is the volume of air (in liters) that can be expelled from the lungs in 
one second.

Usefull for demonstrating linear regressions, also multiple linear regression
with categorical interactions, and change in FEV as a function of height and sex.

### FIELD

Data from a study of the ocular disease Retinitis pigmentosoa (RP). 
The condition can result in substantial loss of vision, in some cases complete
blindness. It has been discovered that this disease is linked to two genes.
Mutations in the rhodosin gene RHO account for many cases that are predominantly
inherited, whereas mutations in the RPGR gene account for many sex-linked
cases; only males can have the RPGR mutation.
The study measures the visual field of approx. 100 patients in each group (RHO and
RPGR). The field of vision is measured in °^2^. 

Are there differences in the baseline level of visual field between the two
groups? Does the rate of decline differ between the two groups?

### HORMONE

Data on the influence of four hormones, compared with a saline solution on
the pancreatic and biliary secretions in laying hens. [White leghorn hens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leghorn_chicken), aged 14-29 weeks, were
fitted with cannulas for collection of pancreatic and biliary secretions, and 
a jugular cannula for infusion of the hormones. One trial pr day was performed,
until the jugular cannula stopped working - therefore there are a different 
number of observations pr. hen. 

Each trial

Det kan have klinisk interesse om længden af indlæggelse er afhængig af 
om patienterne modtager antibiotika behandling.

### NEPHRO

Data from a litterature [study](data.md#buring_5)^5^ on nephrotoxicity of
of several different aminoclycosides.

Note that this dataset is closely related to the datasets EFF and OTO, where
EFF reports efficacy of the preparations, and OTO reports a combination of 
efficacy and side effects. 

We get the sample size of patients in different studies, and the number of 
patients that experienced nephrotoxicity. Which antibiotic is best?

### spermatozoa

Data from a 7 year longitudinal study started in spring 1975 in Edinburgh.
Two classes at an elementary school participated and informed consent were
collected from 40 of the 42 boys in the classes. Every 3 months a 24 hour
urine sample were collected from each boy. These samples were analyzed for the
precense of spermatozoa. In the variable observations are registered the result
of each urine sample.

The purpose of the study was to determine age of spermache.

The format of observations is unusual and suitable for cleaning exercises.

Det kan godt være vi lige skal kigge på:For further details about the study see Nielsen et al. (1986a, 1986b).
