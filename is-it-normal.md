## How to test if our data is normally distributed?

Common question - is my data normally distributed?

What does it mean that it is normally distributed? It means that the
distribution of our data has the same properties as the normal
distribution.

Let us get some data that we can test:


``` r
normal_test_data <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>% 
  select(bill_depth_mm)
```

### Mean and median

One of the properties of the normal distribution is that the mean and
median of the data is equal. Let us look at the penguins:


``` r
summary(normal_test_data)
```

``` output
 bill_depth_mm  
 Min.   :16.40  
 1st Qu.:17.50  
 Median :18.45  
 Mean   :18.42  
 3rd Qu.:19.40  
 Max.   :20.80  
```

This is actually pretty close! But equality between median and mean is a
neccesary, not a sufficient condition.

What next. A histogram of the data should look normal. Let us take a
closer look at bill_depth_mm where mean and median are closest:


``` r
normal_test_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

``` output
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
```

This does not really look like a normal distribution. The fact that mean
and median are almost identical was not a sufficient criterium for
normalcy.

The shape of a histogram is heavily dependent on the bins we choose. A
better way of visualizing often density-plots:


``` r
normal_test_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_density()
```

<img src="fig/is-it-normal-rendered-densityplot-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can think of this as a histogram with infinitely small bins.

This does look more normal - but it would be nice to be able to quantize
the degree of normalcy.

## Percentiels and QQ-plots as a test

The properties of the normal distribution informs us that 50% of the
observations in the data are smaller than the mean (and conversely 50%
are larger). We alson know that 50% of the observations should be in the
interquartile range. And what we also know is that 2.5% of the
observations (the 2.5 percentile) are smaller than the mean minus 1.96
times the standard deviation.

Actually we can calculate exactly which percentile a given observation
is in. And we we can calculate which value a given percentile should
have.

Comparing those gives us an indication of how well the data conforms to
a normal distribution.

Rather than doing that by hand, we can get R to do it for us in a nice
graphical way:


``` r
normal_test_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line()
```

<img src="fig/is-it-normal-rendered-qq-plot-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The `geom_qq` function calculate and plots which percentile an
observation is in.

Rather than being given percentiles, we are given the value that the
percentile corresponds to if we calculate it as number of standard
deviations from the mean.

This results in plots that are more comparable.

`geom_qq_line` plots the line corresponding til the values the
percentiles should have, if the data was normally distributed.

A common theme is that the midle of the data falls relatively close to
the line, and that there are deviations from the line at both ends. In
this case the deviations are largish, indicating that the data is not
normally distributed.

::: callout
We have two tails in the qq-plot, a left and a right. And they can be
either above or below the qq-line.

That results in four different cases, that informs us about what is
wrong with the data - in regards to how it deviates from normalcy.

| Left tail | Right tail | Name         | What                                                                        |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Above     | Below      | Leptokurtic  | Heavier tails - ie. more extreme values. Higher kurtosis                                    |
| Below     | Above      | Platykurtic  | Lighter tails - ie. fewer extreme values. Lower kurtosis                                   |
| Above     | Above      | Right skewed | A tail that stretches to the higher values - the extreme values are larger. |
| Below     | Below      | Left skewed  | A tail that stretches to the lower values - the extreme values are smaller. |

## Numerical measures rather than graphical

With experience the qq-plots can be used to determine if
the data is normally distributed - the points are exactly on
the line. But only rarely the points matches exactly - even
if the data is normally distributed *enough*. And how much
can the tails deviate from the line before the data is not 
normally distributed *enough*?

The deviations can be described numerically using two parameters:

Kurtosis and skewness. 

Base-R do not have functions for this, but the package `e1071` does.



``` r
library(e1071)
```


``` r
skewness(normal_test_data$bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

``` output
[1] 0.006578141
```

kurtosis


``` r
kurtosis(normal_test_data$bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

``` output
[1] -0.960087
```
As a rule of thumb, skewness should be within +/-0.5 if the data is normally distributed. Values between +/-0.5 and +/- 1 
indicates a moderate skewness, where data *can* still be approximately normally distributed. Values larger that +/-1 indicates a
significant skewness, and the data is probably not normally distributed.

For the kurtosis matters are a bit more complicated as the
kurtosis for a normal distribution is 3. We therefore look at 
excess kurtosis, where i subtract 3 from the calculated kurtosis.
An value of +/-1 exces kurtosis indicates that the data has
a 'tailedness' close to the normal distribution.
Values between +/-1 and +/-2 indicates a moderate deviation from
the normal distribution, but the data can still be approximately
normally distributed.
Values larger than +/-2 is in general taken as an indication that the data is not normally distributed.

The absolute value of the excess kurtosis is larger than 2, indicating that
the data is not normally distributed.



## More direct tests

The question of wether or not data is normally distributed is
important in many contexts, and it should come as no surprise
that a multitude of tests has been devised for testing exactly
that.

::::: instructor

These tests can be difficult for learners that have not
encountered hypothesis-testing before.

:::::

### Shapiro-Wilk

The Shapiro-Wilk test is especially suited for small
sample sizes (<50, some claim it works well up to <2000).

It is a measure of the linear correlation between data and
the normally distributed quantiles, what we see in the qqplot.

The null-hypothesis is that data is normally distributed, and
the Shapiro-Wilk test returns a p-value reporting the risk
of being wrong if we reject the null-hypothesis. 


``` r
shapiro.test(normal_test_data$bill_depth_mm) 
```

``` output

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  normal_test_data$bill_depth_mm
W = 0.97274, p-value = 0.1418
```
The p-value in this case is 0.1418 - and we do not have 
enough evidense to reject the null-hypothesis. The data is 
probably normally distributed.

### Kolmogorov-Smirnov

The KS-test allows us to test if the data is distributed
as a lot of different distributions, not only the normal 
distribution. Because of this, we need to specify the
specific distribution we are testing for, in this case
a normal distribution with specific values for mean and
standard deviation.

Therefore we need to calculate those:


``` r
mean <- mean(normal_test_data$bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
sd <- sd(normal_test_data$bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
ks.test(normal_test_data$bill_depth_mm, "pnorm", mean = mean, sd = sd)
```

``` warning
Warning in ks.test.default(normal_test_data$bill_depth_mm, "pnorm", mean =
mean, : ties should not be present for the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
```

``` output

	Asymptotic one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

data:  normal_test_data$bill_depth_mm
D = 0.073463, p-value = 0.8565
alternative hypothesis: two-sided
```
In this test the null-hypothesis is also that data is normally
distributed. The p-values is very high, and therefore we 
cannot reject the null-hypothesis. Again, this is not the same
as the data *actually* being normally distributed. 

This test assumes that there are no repeated values in the data,
as that can affect the precision of the test. The p-value is 
still very high, and we will conclude that we cannot rule out
that the data is not normally distributed.

Note that the KS-test assumes that we actually know the true
mean and standard deviation. Here we calculate those values based on the sample, which is problematic.

### Liliefors test

This is a variation on the KS-test, that is designed specifically
for testing for normality. It does not require us to know the 
true mean and standard deviation for the population.

This test is also not available in base-R, but can be found in
the `nortest` package:


``` r
library(nortest)
lillie.test(normal_test_data$bill_depth_mm)
```

``` output

	Lilliefors (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) normality test

data:  normal_test_data$bill_depth_mm
D = 0.073463, p-value = 0.483
```
Again the p-value is so high, that we cannot reject the null-hypothesis.

### Anderson-Darling test

This test is more sensitive for deviations in the tails.

It is not available in base-R, but can be found in the 
`nortest` package. 


``` r
ad.test(normal_test_data$bill_depth_mm)
```

``` output

	Anderson-Darling normality test

data:  normal_test_data$bill_depth_mm
A = 0.44788, p-value = 0.2714
```
In this case the null-hypothesis is also that data is normally
distributed, and the p-value indicates that we cannot reject
the null-hypothesis.


## And is it actually normally distributed?

Probably not. Except for the excess kurtosis all the tests we have 
done indicate that the depth of the beaks of chinstrap penguins 
can be normally distributed. Or rather, that we cannot reject the
null-hypothesis that they are normally distributed.

But the fact that we cannot reject this hypothesis is not the same
as concluding that the data actually **is** normally distributed. 

Based on the excess kurtosis and the qq-plot, it would be reasonable to
conclude that it is not.
