## Introduction

Here is some data, observations of the distance (in ft) it takes to stop a car driving
at different speeds (in mph):

Not surprisingly the faster the car travels, the longer distance it takes to stop it.

If we want to predict how long a car traveling at 10 mph takes to stop, we could
look at the observations at 10 mph and note that there is some variation. We 
might take the average of those observations, and use that as an estimate of 
how many feet it takes to stop a car traveling at 10 mph. 

But what if we want to predict how long it takes to stop the car if we are driving
it at 12.5 mph instead? That would be nice to know, in order to avoid hitting stuff.
There are no observations in the data at 12.5 mph! We could estimate it as the
average of the (average) stopping distance at 12 mph and at 13 mph (21.5 and 35 ft respectively)
and give an estimate of 28.25 ft.

This is easy - 12.5 is exactly at the middle of the interval of 12 to 13 mph.
But what if we want the distance at 12.4 mph? 

Instead of fiddling with the numbers manually, we note that it appears to be 
possible to draw a straight line through the points, describing the connection 
between the two variables.

Let's do that:


``` r
cars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(speed,dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
```

``` output
`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'
```

<img src="fig/linear-regression-rendered-unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The points do not fall precisely on the line, but it's not very bad.

:::: instructor

Bremselængden er faktisk ikke en lineær funktion af hastigheden. Bilen har
kinetisk (bevægelses) energi så længe den bevæger sig. Den skal vi have ned på 0.
Og eftersom den kinetiske energi er givet ved $E_{kin} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ hvor 
m er bilens masse og v er hastigheden, vil dist afhænge af speed i anden.

::::

When we want to figure out how long it takes to stop a car driving at 12.5 mph,
we can locate 12.5 on the x-axis, move vertically up to the line, and read the
corresponding value on the y-axis, about 30 mph.

But we can do better. Such a line can be described mathematically. Straight lines
in two dimensions can in general be described using the formula:

$$
y = ax + b
$$
or, in this specific case:

$$
dist = a*speed + b
$$

`a` and `b` are the coefficients of this "model". `a` is the slope, or how much
the distance changes, if we change speed by one. `b` is the intercept, the value
where the line crosses the y-axis. Or the distance it takes to stop a car, traveling
at a speed of 0 miles per hour - a value that does not necessarily make sense,
but is still a part of the model.

If we want to be very strict about it, that `=` is not really equal. The expression
describes the straight line, but the actual observations do not actually fall on
the line. If, for a given dist and speed, we want the expression to actually be 
equal, there is some variation that we need to include. We do that by adding 
a `residual`:

$$
dist = a*speed + b + \epsilon
$$

And, if we want to be very mathematical concise, instead of using `a`and `b` for
the coefficients in the expression, we would instead write it like this:

$$
dist = \beta_0 + \beta_1 speed + \epsilon
$$

That is all very nice. But how do we find the actual `a` and `b` (or $\beta_i$)?
What is the "best" line or model for this?

We do that by fitting `a` and `b` to values that minimizes $\epsilon$, that is,
we need to find the difference between the actual observed values, and the 
prediction from the expression or model. Instead of looking at the individual
differences one by one, we look at the sum of the differences, and minimizes that.
However, the observed values can be larger than
the prediction, or smaller. The differences can therefore be both negative and
positive, and the sum can become zero because the difference might cancel each other
out. 

To avoid that problem, we square the differences, and then minimize the sum of the
squares. That is the reason for calling the method for minimizing $\epsilon$,
and by that finding the optimal `a` and `b`, "least squares".

In a simple linear model like this, we can calculate the coefficients directly:


$$\beta_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \overline{x})(y_i - \overline{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \overline{x})^2}$$

$$\beta_0 = \overline{y} - \beta_1\overline{x}$$

We do not want to do that - R can do it for us, with the function `lm()`



``` r
lm(y~x, data = data)
```

y~x is the "formula notation" in R, and describes that y is a function of x.

Using the example from above:


``` r
linear_model <- lm(dist~speed, data = cars)
```

We saved the result of the function in an object, in order to be able to work 
with it. If we just want the coefficients, we can output the result directly:


``` r
linear_model
```

``` output

Call:
lm(formula = dist ~ speed, data = cars)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)        speed  
    -17.579        3.932  
```
This gives us the coefficients of the model. The intercept, `b` or $\beta_0$ is
-17.579. And the slope, `a` or $\beta_1$ is 3.932.

Having a negative intercept, or in this case any intercept different from 0
does not make physical sense - a car travelling at 0 miles pr hour should have 
a stopping distance of 0 ft. 

The slope tells us, that if we increase the speed of the car by 1 mph, the stopping
distance will increase by 3.932 ft.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Can you do it?

What stopping distance does the model predict if the speed i 12.5 mph?


:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Solution
 
3.932*12.5 - 17.579 = 31.571 ft

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Challenge 2: Might there be a problem with that prediction?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

Yep. We might be able to measure the speed with the implied precision.
But the prediction implies a precision on the scale of 1/10000 mm.

We can get more details using the `summary()` function:



``` r
summary(linear_model)
```

lm(formula = dist ~ speed, data = cars)

```
Let us look at that output in detail.

`Call` simply repeats the model that we build, just in case we have forgotten it - 
but also to have the actual model included in the output, in order for other functions
to access it and use it. We will get to that.

The residuals are included. It is often important to take a look at those, and 
we will do that shortly.

Now, the coefficients. 

The estimates for intercept and speed, that is the intercept and the slope of 
the line, are given. Those are the same we saw previously. We also get a standard
error. We need that for testing how much trust we have in the result.

We are almost certain that the estimates of the values for intercept and slope
are not correct. They are estimates after all and we will never know what the
_true_ values are. But we can test if they are zero. 

The hypothesis we can test is - is the coefficient for the slope actually zero,
even though the estimate we get is 3.9? If it is zero, speed will not have any
influence on the stopping distance. So; with what certainty can we rule out that
it is in fact zero?

We are testing the hypothesis that we have gotten a value for speed of 3.9 by 
random chance, but that the true value is zero. If it is zero, the value of
3.9 is 9.5 standard errors away from 0: $3.9324/0.4155 = 9.46426 $. And, using the
t-distribution which describes these sorts of things pretty well, that will happen
very rarely. The Pr, or p-value, is 1.49e-12. That is the chance, or probability,
that we will get a value for the slope in our model that is 9.464 standard errors
away from zero, if the true value of the slope is zero. 

In general if the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the hypothesis that the
true value of the slope is 0.



Since we can assume that the estimates are normally distributed, we can see that,
_if_ the true value of the slope was zero, the value we get here, is 3.9324/0.4155 = 9.46426,
standard errors away from zero. 



RSE is the squareroot of the sum of the squared residuals, divided by the number
of observations, $n$ minus the number of parameters in the model, in this case
2. It is an estimate of the average difference between the observed values, and 
the values the model predicts. We want RSE to be as small as possible. What is small?
That depends on the size of the values. If we predict values in the range of 0 to 2, 
an RSE of 15 is very large. If we predict values in the range 0 to 1000, it is 
small.

Multiple R-squared, is a measure of how much of the variation in `dist` that our
model explains. In this case the model explains ~65% of the variation. Not that
impressive, but acceptable.

The adjusted R-squared adjusts the multiple R-square by the number of independent
variables in the model. It becomes an important measure of how good the model is,
when we get to multiple linear regression, because we will get a better R-squared 
by adding independent variables, even if these variables do not actually have any 
connection to the dependent variables.


The F-statistic is 89.57 and has a p-value of 1.49e-12.

This tests our model against a model where all the slopes (we only have one in this
case) are 0; that is, is the overall model significant. In this case it is, and 
there is overall strong evidence for the claim that the speed of the car influences
the stopping distance.

## Testing the assumptions

We can _always_ make a linear model. The questions is: should we?

There are certain assumptions that needs to be met in order to trust a linear model.

1. There should be a linear connection between the dependent and independent variable. We test
that by comparing the observed values with the predicted values (the straight line).

2. Independence. The observations needs to be independent. If one measurement influences
another measurement, we are not allowed to use a linear model.

3. Normality of residuals. The residuals must be normally distributed.

There exist specific tests for the first two assumptions, but in general we know
our data well enough to determine if they are fulfilled. The third assumptions 
can be tested using a `qqplot`. We begin by extracting the residuals from our
model:

``` r
residuals <- residuals(linear_model)
```

And then plotting them:

``` r
qqnorm(residuals)
qqline(residuals)
```

<img src="fig/linear-regression-rendered-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The points should be (close to be) on the straight line in the plot. In this
case they are close enough.

This is also a handy way to test if our data is normally distributed.

:::: challenge
Test if the residuals in our penguin model from before, are normally distributed.

:::: solution

``` r
penguin_residuals <- residuals(penguin_model)
qqnorm(penguin_residuals)
qqline(penguin_residuals)
```

<img src="fig/linear-regression-rendered-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
They are relatively close to normal.
